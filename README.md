# Data Mining Algorithms from Scratch

This project is in progress:
- we will implement various core data mining algorithms from scratch using minimal libraries (src)
- we will provide demonstrations and discussions of the algorithms in more depth through jupyter notebooks (notebooks directory)
- my goal is to make this a helpful resource when learning or to help refresh understanding
